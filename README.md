## Abstract


This research introduces a technique in the realm of automatic image captioning that leverages the collaborative potential between Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our  method utilizes a two-tiered framework: initially, various VLMs provide diverse verbal descriptions of an image based on unique prompts; subsequently, these array of captions are integrated by a central 'judge' LLM to produce a cohesive and comprehensive caption that encapsulates the essence of the image. The objective of this synergistic approach is to elevate the precision, richness, and contextual appropriateness of image descriptions by pooling together diverse model capabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our dual-model strategy across a spectrum of VLMsâ€”namely Qwen2-VL, Phi-3-vision, and Moondream2â€”and assess its performance on different datasets. Our empirical results indicate that this ensemble method yields image captions with substantially higher quality and depth than traditional single-model approaches, marking a significant stride in the evolution of computer vision technology.

**Note: The 'judge' LLM to code has not been fully completed yet. **

## Introduction

The field of computer vision has undergone significant transformations in recent times, especially within the niche area of generating descriptive text for imagesâ€”a task known as image captioning. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have risen to prominence as instrumental instruments that facilitate the seamless integration of visual information with comprehension of natural language. Despite their capabilities, individual VLMs may possess unique advantages and constraints, which can sometimes result in descriptions that are either biased or lack completeness. This situation thus opens up a scope for creative approaches that can capitalize on the strengths of multiple models to produce more balanced and comprehensive image interpretations.

<h1 align="center">    
  <img src="static/005.png" width="1000%"></a>  
</h1>

To address this issue, we introduce a novel methodology that leverages the combined strengths of multiple VLMs in conjunction with a Large Language Model (LLM) acting as a judge. Our approach is designed to produce more comprehensive, accurate, and contextually rich image captions by following a two-stage process:

1. **Multi-VLM Caption Generation**: In the first stage, we employ several distinct VLMs, including Qwen2-VL, Phi-3-vision, and Moondream2, to generate image descriptions. Each model is prompted with different instructions, encouraging diverse perspectives on the image content. This diversity is crucial, as it allows for a more comprehensive capture of the image's nuances and details.

2. **LLM-based Caption Synthesis**: The second stage involves using a 'judge' LLM to analyse and synthesise the outputs from the first stage. This model is tasked with unifying the various descriptions into a single, coherent caption that captures the essence of all initial responses. The judge LLM's role is not merely to aggregate information but to intelligently combine and refine the insights provided by the VLMs.

Our methodology leverages state-of-the-art models and techniques, including:

- The Qwen2-VL family of models, which offer varying capabilities and model sizes, allowing for a range of perspectives and computational efficiencies.
- Microsoft's Phi-3-vision model, known for its efficiency and performance in visual understanding tasks.
- The Moondream2 model, which brings unique perspectives to image understanding, potentially capturing aspects overlooked by other models.

The implementation utilises advanced libraries such as PyTorch and Hugging Face's Transformers, ensuring efficient processing and easy integration with existing deep learning workflows. We have also incorporated features to handle both individual images and batch processing from datasets or ZIP files, making our approach versatile for various research and practical applications.

By combining multiple VLMs and using an LLM as a judge, we aim to mitigate individual model biases, capture a broader range of image details, and produce captions that are more informative and contextually appropriate. This approach not only improves the quality of image captioning but also opens up new avenues for exploring the synergies between different AI models in multimodal tasks.

It is important to note, however, that while our method shows promise, it is not without limitations. The effectiveness of the approach may vary depending on the specific combination of models used and the nature of the images being captioned. Additionally, the computational resources required for this ensemble approach are significantly higher than those needed for single-model methods, which may limit its applicability in resource-constrained environments.

In the following sections, we shall detail our methodology, present the experimental setup, and discuss the results and implications of our findings. We believe this work contributes significantly to the field of image captioning and demonstrates the potential of ensemble approaches in vision-language tasks.

## Base VLMs

The first phase of the framework isolates each specialized VLM model to individually analyse an input image. Each model processes the image independently, resulting in multiple descriptive outputs from different viewpoints. These models are carefully selected based on their unique strengths in visual and textual analysis, ensuring a comprehensive examination of the image.

For instance, a VLM might be prompted with the following directive:
```
"Provide an extensive description of all elements in this image, including objects, people, and activities."
```

This phase enables the generation of varied textual descriptions and captions, offering diverse perspectives on the visual content.

## Judge VLM

In the second phase, the outputs from the base VLMs are passed to a synthesizing "Judge" VLM model. This model is specifically trained to merge the individual outputs into a coherent, unified conclusion that captures the overall context of the image.

The Judge VLM is designed to handle different types of input data, including textual descriptions from both K and V models. Its role is to harmonise and integrate these multiple viewpoints, providing a more comprehensive synthesis of the image's content.

# How to Use

## Prompts

The framework uses a variety of prompts to guide the Vision-and-Language Modeling (VLM) systems in generating descriptive outputs from images. Each prompt is designed to elicit detailed and specific information from the models.

### Example of Available Prompts

1. **Comprehensive Image Analysis**
   - **Prompt**: 
     ```
     Thoroughly analyse the provided image and generate a comprehensive description of its content. This includes identifying and describing all objects, people, and activities visible in the image. Additionally, detect and extract any text present within the image using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), regardless of the language. Present the extracted text in a structured table format, including columns for the original text, its translation into English, and the language of the text.
     ```
   - **Rationale**: This prompt is designed to provide an exhaustive analysis of the image, encompassing both visual and textual information. It aims to capture every detail, making it suitable for applications where a complete understanding of the image is necessary, such as in detailed reporting or comprehensive data annotation.
